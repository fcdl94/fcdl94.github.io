  <p>Hi, I’m Fabio.
  I'm a never-ending learner, especially interested in deep learning and computer vision.
  In my research, my main goal is to how to learn a representation able to evolve over time requiring as less supervision as possible.

  I’m also interested in various inference methods, neural net architectures including attention and memory, and in everything that
  can be described as “machine reasoning”.
  Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about or work on any of these topics!</p>
